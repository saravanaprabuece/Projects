Encryption is the process of converting readable data into an unreadable format using a key and an algorithm to protect it. Decryption is the reverse process, where the unreadable data is converted back into its original form using the same key (in symmetric encryption) or a different key (in asymmetric encryption). This ensures data security and confidentiality.
